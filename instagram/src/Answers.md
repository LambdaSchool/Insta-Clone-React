From what I gather about the article, There are 2 ways to think about stucturing your react application (probably way more than 2 ways in reality lol).  You can start throwing components everywhere, and maybe your application is a bit of a mess in how it travels between these components.  Or you can use state to your advantage.  By storing alternate data in state.  In the example in the article, you have 2 different things to display based on whether the user is logged in or not.  You could have 2 different components, or you could have one component with the data you need for both stored in the state of one component.  And then conditionaly render which parts of the state you want.  Making your application much easier to work on, test, visualize, and change.  Hopefully my take away from this article isn't way off the mark! =)
