State driven views are important to software developers today because it lets us think in components.
Thinking in coomponents gives us a clear conceptual separation that make things feel easier to work on.
We can work more efficiently with less mistakes and redundancy. We are able to reduced cognitive load. Testing is easier. It is eaiser to right manual/documentation. I also ha close ties with Behaviour Driven Development techniques. Facebook and Instagram are examples of state-driven applications. They are powerful because they can process constantly changing and updating information in efficiently without lag.
