    State driven development (SSD) is an awesome concept. It allows for easier testing, better readability and better performance within our apps. 
We are able to program efficiently when it comes to state (whether its being logged in/out or if you have a certain item or not) we are able to 
have paths in our application that gives us functionality over what we are trying to do.
    React allows us to set state in our apps to control what happens when we do somthing like logging into a website or if we have a subscription
that allows us to have VIP features. This makes state driven views really powerful.
