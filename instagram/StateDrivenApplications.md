i think that state driven views are very important to development. they offer a completely different appreach to planning an app and allow for the separation of componetes to flow in clearer and concise paths. state driven applications are applications that run certin componets based on state, rather then creating componenets based on UI or other methods of breaking down components. State driven applications are powerful because they provide concise paths for the data of an application to follow. they also in certin cases reduce unnessesary data from coming thorugh, by chosing paths based on state. Testing is also greatly reduced becuase as the componetes are spearated by state, they have far less conflicting data. React allows those patterns from the way components are passed to eadchother, and using Higher Ordcer Componetes for test cases.
