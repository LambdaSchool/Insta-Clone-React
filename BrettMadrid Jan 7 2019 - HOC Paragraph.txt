From what I can understand, prior to React, development was primarily approached at from a visual standpoint first and then the state was  somehow worked into the design.  But by putting state first in consideration from a design standpoint (not visual design, but rather development design and layout) then the development was better and more maintainable.  I see HOC as another step in making components more powerful and reusable.
