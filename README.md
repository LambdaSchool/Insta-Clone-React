# React-InstaClone

### Deployment

Client: [React-InstaClone](https://react-instaclone.netlify.com)

-- Note: this project did not include responsiveness. Responsiveness is a TODO

## Objectives

The purpose of this project is to continue building on your knowledge of React that you have gained thus far. 

For this project, you'll be building a simple desktop Instagram clone using React. There is a file provided called `dummy-data.js` that contains some mock data. Each object in the mock data represents a faux Instagram post. Your React application will receive this faux post data and render each as a separate Instagram post.

By the end of this project, you should be comfortable with what components are, the notion of state within a component, as well as passing data from a parent component down to a child component.
