So I am clear on the assignment we are:
1.  Making an Instagram clone ('instaClone'?)
2.  It will live in the REACT-II folder
3.  We can use one of two approaches: Test-driven (run, see what breaks, then fix) or logic-driven (if that's a thing) where we get it looking kind of right with all components in place THEN r/b/f.
4.  We avoid file hierarchy issues by moving '/tests' and 'dummy-data.js' into 'instagram/src' so that those files are on the same level as 'App.js'
5. We use Bootstrap to give it a bit of the 'continental flair'.
6.  There are three components identified: SearchBar, PostContrainer, CommentSection.
7.  All components should go in a new directory named 'src/components'.

Did I miss anything?
